## Random Walk Data Visualization with Matplotlib
_____
The goal of this post is to **walk** you through using a random walk to create
the plot points for a visualization representing a piece of pollen's floating
on water.

### Random Walk Class
It all starts with a RandomWalk() Class that we can reuse for each visualiztion.
```python

```

### Pollen Plot 1: Simple
Now that we have our class, it's time to instantiate an object from that class
and visualize it's path.

```python

```

Output:
